# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it also follows the concept of simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the writers needs.

Here are some **milestones** of the past:

- Added a basic content editor to edit and delete existing pages (v. 1.2.0)
- Added a draft management for pages (v. 1.2.2)
- Re-order content pages with drag&drop (v. 1.2.3)

And here is the **roadmap** for this year (2018):
