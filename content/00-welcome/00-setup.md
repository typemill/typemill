# Setup

Congratulations! If you see this page, then the setup of the system has worked successfully!! You can now login (/tm/login) and configure your system, your themes and your plugins. You will find all settings in the settings-area (/tm/settings).

If you face any problems during the installation, then please make sure, that your system supports these features:

---

- PHP version 7+.
- Apache server.
- The module `mod_rewrite` and `htaccess`.

If you run a linux-system like Debian or Ubuntu, then please double check that `mod_rewrite` and `htaccess` are activated. Check this [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/typemill/typemill/issues/16) for help.

Please make the following folders writable with permission 774 (you can use your ftp-software for it):

- Cache
- Content
- Media
- Settings

If you still get an error, then you can post an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/typemill/typemill).
