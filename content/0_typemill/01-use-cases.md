# Use Cases

Whenever you want to publish a finished text work as a website and if you like writing with Markdown, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Possible use cases are ...

- a documentation
- a manual
- a user guide
- a whitepaper
- a handbook
- a tutorial
- a study
- a book
- a drama
- a lyric collection
- a collection of articles

If you want to create a blog, a wiki or a classic corporate website, please use a specialized CMS for that instead of TYPEMILL.

TYPEMILL is under heavy developement and not finished right now. It has an admin panel for settings and a very basic editor for existing content. More options like delete or create new pages and manage your media-files will be added step by step in next weeks. Also  different output formats like mobi and ePup are on the roadmap, so stay tuned.

You have to use a FTP-software like FileZilla until the basic editing features are ready. Check the roadmap for more informations.
