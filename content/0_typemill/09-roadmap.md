# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it also follows the concept of simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the writers needs. 

Here are some milestones of the past:

- Introduction of TYPEMILL version 1.0.0
- Added a table of contents tag (TOC) with version 1.0.5
- Introduced plugins with version 1.1.0
- Added an author panel to configure the system with version 1.1.3

And here is the roadmap for the future:

- Add a content editor to create and edit your pages online.
- Add an Image- and media-management.
- Support mathematical formulars for scientific text works.
- Create additional output formats like mobi, epub and pdf.
- Create a clean API.
- More themes for special publications like documentations, books or lyrics.
- Create a lot of cool plugins
