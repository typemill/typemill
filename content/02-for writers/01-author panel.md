# The Author Panel

After you have setup your TYPEMILL website, you can login to the author panel. The login url is 

````
https://yourwebsite.net/tm/login
````

You can also use the url `https://yourwebsite.net/setup` that redirects to the login screen.

## The Content Editor

In the **content area** of the author panel you can:

* Navigate through your existing content.
* Edit all existing content pages with markdown syntax.
* Re-order existing content with simple drag&drop.

There are several **limitations** right now:

* You cannot use HTML, JavaScript or any other code in the editor, only markdown-syntax is allowed.
* You cannot delete, create or reorder the pages right now (use FTP for this), but these features are on the way.
* There is no media-management right now.

The content editor has highest priority in the roadmap, so you can expect al lot of improvements in the next weeks.

## Settings, Themes and Plugins

In the **settings area** of the author panel you can:

* Configure your **system**.
* Choose and configure a **theme**.
* Activate and configure **plugins**.
* Manage **users**.
